It is predicted that in 2 years, across the Horn of Africa <a>15 million people will not have access to safe drinking</a>(OXFAM, 2017). Access to clean drinking water is essential for all life, and sources of water are not enough during a drought. Without the presence of water, people must bring in enough water from elsewhere to survive. Mostly the women or children have to walk tens of kilometers in order to bring back just a few buckets of water. During this time children are not able to go to school and receive the education they need. \r\n                        </div>\r\n                        <div id=\"paragraph\">It is also predicted that in 2 years, <a>12.7 million people will face severe hunger in the  Horn of Africa</a>(OXFAM, 2017). Water is also needed for crops to grow. When not enough precipitation falls to naturally water crops, they must be watered by irrigation. Irrigation is possible only when there is enough water in nearby rivers, lakes, or streams. During a drought, <a>these water sources are diminished and may even dry up,</a> preventing crops from being irrigated and causing them to die off.</div>\r\n                        <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeInUp\">\r\n                            <img src={require(\"./../../assets/imgs/kenya/social.jpg\")}/>\r\n                            <figcaption></figcaption>\r\n                        </ScrollAnimation>\r\n                        </ScrollAnimation>\r\n\r\n                        <ScrollAnimation className=\"cause\" animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeIn\">\r\n\r\n                        <div id=\"heading\">economic impacts</div>\r\n                        <div id=\"paragraph\">Drought can cost people, businesses and governments money. These impacts may be local, and only affect those in the drought-stricken area, or they may be widespread and impact people living outside the drought affected area. In the agricultural industry, <a>lack of precipitation can damage or kill crops, and negatively impact farmers’ income.</a> One season with low growth, can be enough to ruin a farmer's income for multiple years. A low yield in one season, decreases the amount of money available in the next season.

Before the Election in 2017, the severe drought affecting Kenya, which <a>increased the cost of food and fuelled inflation,</a> became a key issue in the election campaign. The price of maize flour, known as unga increased by 31%, milk by 12% and sugar by 21%. These increases drove up inflation to 11.5%(Okiror, 2017). <a>The opposition used soaring food prices and the high cost of living to discredit the government.</a> Many blamed president Kenyatta for failing to plan, mitigate and respond to the effects of the drought.

Forcing stricter restrictions on non-essential water use is crucial to <a>having a large water reserve for droughts,</a> along with improving efficiency standards in buildings, making sure that all water is being put to good use. <a>Maintenance and repair programs on distribution infrastructure</a> to decrease the amount of leaks and disruptions in the water distribution process.\r\n\r\n                        </div>\r\n\r\n                        <div id=\"paragraph\">For the long term innovative ideas need to be created in order to mitigate the effects of a drought. In the agricultural standpoint there is crop engineering. Although there has been backlash over the years from GMOs, in a high risk situation they might be the answer. <a>Food production is a crucial part of keeping the population alive.</a> However, droughts affect productivity and create food insecurity. Crop engineering can be used to <a>tweak the genetics of existing crops to help them increase their yield</a> and provide them with better resistance to drought. A research project from Realizing Increased Photosynthetic Efficiency(RIPE) has successfully improved corps in the way they use water, up to 25% more efficiently(PHYS.ORG). Although 25% may not seem like a lot, when it's come to agriculture, <a>it could mean hundreds of liters of water.</a></div>\r\n\r\n                        <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeInUp\">\r\n                        <img src={require(\"./../../assets/imgs/kenya/RIPE.png\")}/>\r\n                            <figcaption></figcaption>\r\n                        </ScrollAnimation>\r\n                        </ScrollAnimation>\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\nexport default Kenya;","import React, {Component, useRef, useState, useEffect, useCallback} from \"react\";\r\n\r\nimport CountUp from 'react-countup';\r\nimport ScrollAnimation from 'react-animate-on-scroll';\r\nimport \"animate.css/animate.min.css\";\r\n\r\nimport \"../../assets/stylesheets/CountryPages/KenyaPage.css\"\r\nimport \"../../assets/stylesheets/CountryPages/Common.css\"\r\n\r\nclass Jakarta extends Component {\r\n\r\n    componentWillMount() {\r\n        document.body.id = 'style-2';\r\n    }\r\n\r\n    render() {\r\n        return (\r\n            <div >\r\n\r\n            <div id=\"outer\">\r\n                <div id=\"inner\">\r\n                    <div id=\"title-jakarta\">Jakarta Sea Level Rise</div>\r\n\r\n                </div>\r\n            </div>\r\n            <div id=\"cont\">\r\n            <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeIn\">\r\n                <div id=\"heading\">the problem</div>\r\n                <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">A recent study has identified <a>Jakarta as among the world’s major metropolitan areas on the brink of sinking</a> as a result of rising sea levels and extreme weather caused by climate change. Much of the city is projected to be <a>completely submerged within the next twenty five years.</a> The problem is so severe that Indonesia had to take an extraordinary step by <a>moving its capital away from Jakarta,</a> to the island of Borneo.

As water heats, it expands. These reactions can be seen in all oceans and was the main driver of <a>sea level rise in the past 100 years.</a> The melting of ice glaciers, ice caps and ice sheets is adding even more water to the world's oceans(UCSUSA, 2013). Jakarta is not just sinking because of Global warming, but also because of <a>Land-subsidence.</a> Land-subsidence <a>is a consequence of unmoderated human activity.</a> Land-subsidence is caused by the extraction of large volumes of groundwater from aquifers beneath the city, the sinking is further exacerbated by the soft, swampy ground on which the city sits. Despite some of this extraction being illegal, the city does not have the resources to enforce it effectively and, due to the <a>inadequate provision of drinkable water to many of its districts,</a> the locals often have no alternative.\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeInUp\">\r\n                        <img src={require('../../assets/imgs/kenya/drought.jpg')}/>\r\n                    </ScrollAnimation>\r\n                    </ScrollAnimation>\r\n\r\n                <ScrollAnimation className=\"cause\" animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeIn\">\r\n                    <div id=\"heading\">who are the stakeholders?</div>\r\n\r\n                    < div id = \"paragraph-jakarta\" >Unlike other issues, rising sea levels will have a large impact on the rich.

But the <a>rich owners of the building will be put into a great loss.</a> The millions put into a building will be ruined in a matter of months. But like every issue, sea level rise will greatly impact poor families. Many do not have the money to move to a new location, where <a>prices will be higher due to the demand.</a> Currently due to flooding street food works are facing a huge loss, as the city floods people are less inclined to get out of the house and makes it difficult to walk around with their stalls. These floods are also affecting middle class families, who are unable to go to work and their children are unable to go to school. As it may seem that sea level rise helps the environment by creating more water ecosystems. <a>The contact between the city and water will destroy it.</a> All the harmful chemicals used in our homes will enter into the ocean.\r\n</div>\r\n                    \r\n                </ScrollAnimation>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"cause\">\r\n\r\n                    <div id=\"heading\">economic impacts</div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">The destruction of infrastructure creates large economic deficits, as floods become more common building owners are finding it very costly to do temporary repairs every time. With large floods rendering some builds useless. Jakarta is the heart of Indonesia, both culturally and economically. It contributes the most of any province to Indonesia's GDP with a GRP of about $300 000 USD. If Jakarta sinks into the ocean Indonesia's economy will lose its largest producer and about a 5th of its GDP.\r\n</div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">\r\n                    Even trying to save the city is becoming a costly project. They will also have to spend a massive amount of money on the giant seawall around $42 billion. That’s the choice coastal cities are increasingly facing, to spend money to adapt now or suffer worse down the road.\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                    <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeInUp\">\r\n                        <img src=\"./imgs/kenya/.jpg\"/>\r\n                    </ScrollAnimation>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"cause\">\r\n\r\n                    <div id=\"heading\">environmental impacts</div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">Many forms of wildlife make their home on the beach. As the rising ocean erodes the shoreline and floods the areas in which coastal animals live, animals like shorebirds and sea turtles will suffer. Their nests may be swept away by flooding, an especially big problem for endangered animals like sea turtles that can't afford to lose any offspring. Their habitats may be so damaged by flooding or changes in the surrounding plant life that they can no longer survive in the environment.\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">More saltwater hitting our shores will change the chemistry of the soil on the coast, meaning the plant life there will most likely change as well. As rising ocean water seeps into the ground, the soil near the coast will become saltier. Some plants will simply be unable to cope with the change in soil salinity and may disappear from the shoreline. Researchers have claimed that Trees have to work harder to pull water out of salty soil. As a result, their growth can be stunted and if the soil is salty enough, they will die.(Climate Central, 2009). Even though Jakarta is a city, it does contain many large garden and green areas, which are home to many animals and plants.\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n                    <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeInUp\">\r\n                        <img src=\"./imgs/kenya/.jpg\"/>\r\n                    </ScrollAnimation>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"cause\">\r\n\r\n                    <div id=\"heading\">political impacts</div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">Jakarta’s former governor, Basuki Tjahaja Purnama, tried to tackle several of Jakarta’s big problems. But failed, to wrest control of the water supply from the private companies. He assembled a sanitation crew, called the Orange Army, to remove sediment and garbage from rivers and canals. He cleared out some of the villages that obstructed waterways. The efforts began to make a difference. Rains that once caused days of floods drained within hours. \r\n</div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">But many people forced out, resisted the moves, convinced that the evictions were really intended to enrich developers, not improve drainage. These villages became the center of protest against the governor. This conflict was quickly turned into a violent anti-Chinese movement by his political rivals. This issue was turned into an argument about whether a non-Muslim should lead a Muslim-majority city. The governor found himself regularly attacked at Friday prayers. He lost his re-election bid, and the Islamists, who exploited anger against him, had him brought up on charges of blasphemy. He is serving two years in prison(KIMMELMAN, 2017)\r\n</div>\r\n\r\n                    <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeInUp\">\r\n                        <img src=\"./imgs/kenya/.jpg\"/>\r\n                    </ScrollAnimation>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"cause\">\r\n\r\n                    <div id=\"heading\">what solutions have been tried?</div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">The country has spent billions to defend itself from rising sea levels. With multiple proposed plans either failing or not being approved by the locals. In 2019 they created a new plan for an offshore seawall, which has gone through its first approval. It is scheduled to begin construction in 2023. The plan proposes a 40km wall along the shore, costing a total of $4 billion plus another 4 billion for pumping stations and reservoirs. Jakarta knows the amount of trouble it is in, and is doing everything they can to delay the inevitable. But with politics and economy at its every step, they have one chance to do it right. \r\n</div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">There have been attempts to slow down the temperature increase. For example The Paris Agreement, adopted in 2015 by 175 parties, aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C compared to pre-industrial levels. However, the period 2010-2020 was the planet's hottest decade on record and the long-term trend is upward. As technology spreads, so does the need for energy.  To keep up demands countries are needing to rely heavily on fossil fuels, which has worsened the effects of global warming.\r\n</div>\r\n                    <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeInUp\">\r\n                        <img src=\"./imgs/kenya/.jpg\"/>\r\n                    </ScrollAnimation>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n                <div className=\"cause\">\r\n\r\n                    <div id=\"heading\">what needs to happen to solve the problem?\r\n                    </div>\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">Although climate change is a large factor in rising sea levels, there is not much Indonesia can do by itself. But what it can do is slow down other factors that are sinking the city. Land-subsidence is causing the city to sink. Stopping this would help decrease the effects of sea level rise. First they need to create a sustainable water management plan to end unmonitored extraction of large volumes of groundwater from aquifers beneath the city. Retrofitting one of the world’s biggest cities with a sewer system is not easy task and will cost billions.\r\n\r\n                    </div>\r\n\r\n                    <div id=\"paragraph-jakarta\">Secondly, learning from other flooding cities will mitigate the current effects. Creating a 'Waterproof' urban plan prepares the city's infrastructure for large floods. For example in Bangkok, the Centennial Park was established to protect the sinking city from flooding during heavy rainfalls. With artificial wetlands and a water tank below, the park can store up to 4,564 cubic metres of water .\r\n</div>\r\n                    <ScrollAnimation animateOnce animateIn=\"animate__fadeInUp\">\r\n                        <img src=\"./imgs/kenya/.jpg\"/>\r\n                    </ScrollAnimation>\r\n                </div>\r\n\r\n            </div>\r\n\r\n        </div>\r\n        );\r\n    }\r\n}\r\n\r\nexport default Jakarta;","import React, {Component} from \"react\";\nimport {BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Switch} from \"react-router-dom\";\n\nimport MapChart from \"./MapChart\";\nimport Kenya from \"./CountryPages/Kenya\"\nimport Jakarta from \"./CountryPages/Jakarta\"\nclass App extends Component {\n    render() {\n        return (\n            <Router>\n                <div>\n                    <Route exact path=\"/wi\" component={MapChart}/>\n                    <Route exact path=\"/wi/kenya\" component={Kenya}/>\n                    <Route exact path=\"/wi/jakarta\" component={Jakarta}/>\n                </div>\n            </Router>\n        );\n    }\n}\nexport default App;","import React from \"react\";\nimport { BrowserRouter } from \"react-router-dom\";\nimport ReactDOM from \"react-dom\";\n\nimport App from \"./components/App\";\n\nconst rootElement = document.getElementById(\"root\");\nReactDOM.render(\n  <BrowserRouter>\n    <App />\n  </BrowserRouter>,\n  rootElement\n);\n"],"sourceRoot":""}
